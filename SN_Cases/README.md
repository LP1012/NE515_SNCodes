# SN Cases

The included cases run modified versions of `SN1` where the running conditions have been changed to match the cases in the provided `.pdf` document.
Note that Case 6 was *not* created, as it was included in the `SN2` cases developed along with the Reed problem.

## Running 
Use the `run` bash script included to compile and run the code and plot the output.

## Plotting
A `make_plots.py` has been written to generate plots of all generated `.csv' files. 
This can be run with `python3 make_plots.py`.
